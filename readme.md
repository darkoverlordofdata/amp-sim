# amp-sim

inspired by https://pedals.io

Amplifier Simulator using wad.js and webaudio-controls.js .

## issues in Linux
Ostensibly, this is cross platform. Practically speaking, it works like crap in Linux (pedals.io has the same issue). This is because the microphone is not handled well in Linux. So far, deepin and rebornos are the only distros I find usable.
